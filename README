 This if the "Filler" process. initializes an array with 100 cells.
it loops a 100 times getting data through named-pipe from 3 other processes if 
the number sent by the process is bigger/equal to the last number in the array it 
inserts that number in the array and send the matching process 1. if the number is not 
larger/equal it send 0. after 100 iterations, whether the array is full or not, 
it prints the data we were asked to show (array size, min value, max value).
then it sends -1 to the process indicating to finish and printing how many number each process has entered o the array.

This is the "prime number creators" program. when they are ran 
they create a pipe with the filler process.when all 3 creators are 
up and running they receive a signal to start drawing random prime number and
sending them to the Filler. if the number the process draws enters the array
im the Filler it adds one to a counter. after the Filler is finished and sent the 
signal to the process here to finish this process prints how much numbers it managed 
to insert in the array.

This program is our server that checks for prime numbers.
it receives a string of number through the message queue.
it goes over all the number in the strings and checks for prime numbers it 
adds all the prime number to a new string and sends it back to the client

This program is our server that checks for palindromes numbers.
it receives a string from the client through the message queue.
it checks if the string is a palindrome it sends '+' back through the queue.
if it's not a palindrome it sends '-' back

this is the front end side of our program.
it prompts the user to enter a command 'q' or 'p'.
'p': it waits for the user to enter a series of numbers that end with a 0.
it sends those number through the message queue to the server that checks for prime
numbers and after it gets the response it prints it to the screen.
'q': it waits for the user to enter a string. it sends the string to the server that 
checks for palindromes and then rints the answer it got from the server to console.
